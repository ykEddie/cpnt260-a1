### Problems/Solutions
I had a bit of trouble actually making the repo and initializing it, but after entering all the commands through the VS Code terminal (Git Bash wasn't letting me paste for some reason) I was able to get everything set up.

When adding all the code into my html file I forgot to add all the extra things that needed to go in the `<head>` part so nothing actually looked the way it was supposed to. Also forgot I had to link my css styles file to the html so  once I added that and went live to see how it looked it was all good.

### Attributions
I used assets through Codepen and it directly added the pictures for me so I am not sure how to do the attribution for that.

### Flares
  - Added a hover to the nav bar (line 88-89)
  - Set a colour theme (purple, grey, black, and white)
