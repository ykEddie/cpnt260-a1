        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Ed Adeagbo, I was born in Nigeria but I moved to London, UK when I was just 3. Have a decently sized family, but I am the youngest child and the only boy. Lived in London up until the 4th grade when my family then moved to Canada and I have lived here ever since, however I did spend a year in Houston, TX when I was 12 then came back to Canada.</p>
        <p>For the first few years I could not stand this province due to the sudden change in weather but I've now grown accustomed to it (I don't even wear a jacket when it's -1 anymore). My family used to travel a lot and I visited a lot of cool places such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>France</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Spain</strong></li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_(disambiguation)" target="_blank">California (won a free trip to Disneyland)</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ever since I was young I was really into <strong>sports</strong>, the 2 main sports I played and still actively play are <strong>volleyball</strong> and <strong>basketball</strong>. I got into volleyball because my junior high team didn't have enough members for a team (cause we all thought it was a "girls sport") but the coach convinced me and a few others to try out and from there I couldn't stop playing.</p>
        <p>I am a <strong>HUGE</strong> anime and manga fan which eventually led me to Marvel, but animanga will always be my favourite form of media. The first anime I watched was Fairy Tail, but after years and years of consistently watching new animes I think it's safe to name my top 3 (in no specific order):</p>      
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One Piece</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Attack on Titan</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Jojo's Bizzare Adventures</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>*Random note: Spiderman is my favourite MCU hero</p>
